# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Add equipment subcommands to PlayerCommand

  - Implement `/player <name> equip <armor_type>` command for full armor sets
  - Implement `/player <name> equip <slot> <item>` command for individual pieces
  - Add `/player <name> unequip <slot>` command to remove equipment
  - Add `/player <name> equipment` command to display current equipment status
  - Create EquipmentSlotMapping utility for string-to-slot conversion
  - Create ArmorSetDefinition utility for predefined armor sets
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Enhance EntityPlayerMPFake equipment synchronization

  - Implement syncEquipmentToClients method to force client updates
  - Update onEquipItem method to call synchronization after equipment changes
  - Add equipment state caching to prevent redundant sync operations
  - Create equipment update packet handling for nearby players
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 4.1, 5.4_

- [x] 3. Test and validate Scarpet equipment functions

  - Test inventory_set function with equipment inventory type
  - Verify numeric parameter validation for equipment slot numbers (0-5)
  - Test string-based slot name support if not working ('head', 'chest', etc.)
  - Add proper error handling with descriptive messages for invalid parameters
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Create vanilla command integration for auto-equipment

  - Create mixin to intercept /give commands targeting fake players
  - Implement auto-equipment logic for armor items when slots are empty
  - Add armor comparison logic to prioritize better armor when replacing
  - Send feedback messages to command sender about equipment changes
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 4.2_

- [x] 5. Implement comprehensive error handling and validation

  - Add parameter validation for all equipment commands
  - Create helpful error messages with syntax examples
  - Implement graceful handling of invalid item names and slot references
  - Add logging for debugging equipment synchronization issues
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4, 3.3_

- [x] 6. Add equipment persistence and dimension handling

  - Ensure equipment persists when fake players change dimensions
  - Implement proper equipment handling during fake player respawn
  - Add equipment state restoration after server restarts
  - Test equipment synchronization across different game scenarios
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 7. Add enhanced Scarpet equipment functions (if needed)

  - Implement equipment_get() function to retrieve current equipment
  - Add equipment_clear() function to remove equipment from slots
  - Create modify() function overload specifically for equipment manipulation
  - Add NBT support for enchanted equipment through Scarpet functions
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 8. Create comprehensive test suite

  - Write unit tests for equipment slot mapping and validation
  - Create integration tests for all new player commands
  - Test Scarpet equipment functions with various parameter combinations
  - Implement manual testing scenarios for equipment visibility and protection
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4, 4.3, 4.4_

- [x] 9. Integrate and test complete system

  - Test all equipment methods work together seamlessly
  - Verify equipment changes are visible to all connected players
  - Test armor protection values work correctly in combat scenarios
  - Validate performance impact of equipment synchronization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.4_
