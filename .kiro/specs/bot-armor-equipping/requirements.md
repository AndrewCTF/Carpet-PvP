# Bot Armor Equipping - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the current issues with fake players (bots) not being able to properly equip armor through both Scarpet scripting commands and vanilla Minecraft commands. The system needs to provide reliable methods for players to equip armor on fake players for testing, automation, and gameplay purposes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a server administrator, I want to equip armor on fake players using simple commands, so that I can set up testing scenarios and automated gameplay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs a Scarpet command to equip armor THEN the fake player SHALL successfully equip the specified armor piece
2. WHEN a user uses vanilla `/give` command on a fake player THEN the fake player SHALL be able to receive and auto-equip armor items
3. WHEN armor is equipped on a fake player THEN the armor SHALL be visible to all players on the server
4. WHEN armor is equipped on a fake player THEN the armor SHALL provide proper protection values during combat

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player using Carpet mod, I want intuitive commands to manage fake player equipment, so that I can quickly set up bots for various purposes without complex syntax.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user types `/player <name> equip <armor_type>` THEN the system SHALL equip a full set of the specified armor type
2. WHEN a user types `/player <name> equip <slot> <item>` THEN the system SHALL equip the specific item in the specified equipment slot
3. WHEN invalid parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with correct syntax examples
4. WHEN the fake player doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL provide a clear error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a technical Minecraft player, I want Scarpet functions to work correctly for equipment manipulation, so that I can create complex automation scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using `inventory_set()` with equipment inventory THEN the function SHALL accept proper numeric and string parameters without syntax errors
2. WHEN using `modify()` function for equipment THEN the function SHALL correctly update the fake player's equipment slots
3. WHEN equipment is changed via Scarpet THEN the changes SHALL be immediately visible and functional
4. WHEN Scarpet equipment functions are used THEN they SHALL work consistently with both fake and real players

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a server operator, I want fake players to behave like real players regarding equipment, so that testing scenarios are accurate and realistic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN armor is equipped on a fake player THEN the armor SHALL provide the same protection as it would for real players
2. WHEN a fake player takes damage THEN equipped armor SHALL reduce damage according to vanilla mechanics
3. WHEN armor durability decreases THEN the fake player's armor SHALL show proper durability loss
4. WHEN armor breaks THEN the fake player SHALL behave the same as a real player (armor disappears, protection lost)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a mod user, I want equipment changes to persist properly, so that fake players maintain their equipment across server restarts and dimension changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a fake player is equipped with armor THEN the equipment SHALL persist when the fake player moves between dimensions
2. WHEN a fake player respawns after death THEN the system SHALL handle equipment according to configured respawn rules
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN fake players SHALL maintain their equipment state if they are configured to persist
4. WHEN equipment synchronization occurs THEN all connected clients SHALL see the correct equipment state
